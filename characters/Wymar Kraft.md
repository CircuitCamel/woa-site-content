## Backstory

For years, Wymar Kraft fought in the Trivarian army alongside his comrade and close friend, Max Barion. During one of their joint missions with another platoon, they encountered Aster a boy who looked no older than sixteen. Wymar quickly realized Aster had been forced into the army, likely due to his deadly combat skills.

  

Years later, exhausted by the relentless bloodshed and disillusioned by the twisted orders from their superiors, Wymar and Max made a decision: they would escape the army and they would take Aster with them. It was the only way to free him from the grasp of the military’s higher-ups.

  

After parting ways with Max, who left to walk his own path, Wymar and Aster (who now lived under a different name) settled quietly in Waterdeep. There, Wymar helped care for Aster, who had lost both his arms during the war. He taught him how to use the _Mage Hand_ spell to make up for what he had lost until, a few months later, they managed to secure proper arm replacements for him.

  

With Aster healing and finding some peace, Wymar discovered a new purpose for himself: **treasure hunting**.

He joined the Adventurers’ Guild, accepting various contracts and delving into forgotten ruins. Over time, he formed a tight-knit group of six:

- *Darx and Drax*  two elven brothers notorious for their constant bickering. Darx wielded magic as a wizard, while Drax, a rogue-in-training, honed his skills under Wymar’s guidance.

- ⁠*Hudson*  a stout, boisterous dwarf known for his battleaxe and an even bigger heart.

- *Hosh*  a disciplined human fighter who naturally assumed the role of leader.

- ⁠*Tasha*  a human cleric with unparalleled healing abilities and a quiet wisdom that grounded the team.

Wymar became the party’s scout and survivalist. With his roguish instincts and keen senses, he guided them safely through treacherous terrain, uncovered hidden paths, and found shelter when hope seemed lost. He had an uncanny talent for discovering treasures.

As time passed, his bond with Tasha blossomed into love. Four years after leaving the military, they married, inviting Aster, Wymar’s former protégé, to the ceremony. This joyous occasion was set to take place right after their final expedition an arduous two-year quest chasing whispers of a magical relic buried in a sunken temple far beyond the coast.

The expedition was grueling:

- ⁠Darx’s arcane skills helped them navigate magical wards.

- ⁠Wymar and Drax deftly avoided traps and solved intricate puzzles.

- Hudson and Hosh bravely fought back waves of undead.

- Tasha’s divine grace kept everyone alive through the darkest moments.

Finally, they reached the relic. But before Wymar could shake off the unease creeping at the back of his mind, Tasha screamed. An arrow pierced her chest, and ambushers erupted from the shadows.

Chaos ensued. Wymar and his team fought valiantly, but the odds were merciless. Despite their courage, the ambushers soon overpowered them. One by one, his friends fell.

When the dust settled, Wymar stood alone.

Devastated and barely clinging to life, he escaped the temple and returned to the mainland, directionless and broken.

The Adventurers’ Guild soon found him not to offer solace, but to accuse. Word had spread: Wymar was the last survivor, and the implications were damning. Before he could be imprisoned, he fled into the wilderness.

He wandered for days, alone and near death, until he collapsed deep in the forest. There, a kind old woman named Namy discovered him and nursed him back to health. He stayed, helping her with chores, hunting, and gradually rediscovering a sense of purpose however faint.

But peace is fleeting. One day, the authorities came knocking. Wymar knew then that the past always finds its way back.

## Backstory

After countless battles in the Trivarian army, Wymar Kraft and his trusted crew of four finally laid down their arms. Tired of bloodshed and disillusioned by orders from above, they disbanded and went their separate ways. Seeking purpose in peacetime, Wymar wandered aimlessly—until he found a calling in exploration.

He joined the Adventurers’ Guild, taking odd contracts and exploring forgotten ruins. Over time, he settled into a group of six:
- Darx and Drax — two elven brothers known for constant bickering. Darx was a wizard, and Drax a rogue-in-training under Wymar’s guidance.
-	Hudson — a stocky, loud dwarf with a battleaxe and a bigger heart.
-	Hosh — a disciplined human fighter who naturally led the party.
-	Tasha — a human cleric with unmatched healing and a quiet sense of wisdom.

Wymar became the party’s scout and survivalist. With his roguish instincts and sharp senses, he led them safely through treacherous terrain, uncovered hidden paths, and found shelter when all seemed lost. He had a talent for finding things—especially treasure.

Over time, his bond with Tasha deepened into love. Four years after his military retirement, they married. Aster, Wymar’s former protégé, was invited to the ceremony. The couple had just returned from a two-year expedition chasing whispers of a magical relic buried in a sunken temple far beyond the coast.

The expedition had been grueling:
-	Darx’s arcane skills led them through magical wards.
-	Wymar and Drax navigated traps and puzzles.
-	Hudson and Hosh fought back hordes of undead.
-	Tasha kept everyone alive through divine grace.

Finally, they reached the relic.

But before Wymar could react to the unease prickling in the back of his mind—Tasha screamed. An arrow struck her through the chest. Ambushers emerged from the shadows.

The battle was chaos. Wymar and his team fought valiantly, but the odds were cruel. Despite their efforts, the ambushers overpowered them. One by one, his friends fell.

When the dust settled, Wymar was alone.

Devastated and barely alive, he escaped the temple. He returned to the mainland, directionless and broken.

The Adventurers’ Guild soon found him—not to offer comfort, but to accuse. Word had reached them: Wymar was the last survivor. The implication was damning. Before he could be imprisoned, Wymar fled into the wilderness.

He wandered for days, alone and near death, until he collapsed deep in the forest. There, a kind old woman named Namy found him and nursed him back to health. He stayed, helping with chores, hunting, and finding purpose again—however faint.

But peace never lasts.

One day, the authorities came knocking.

And Wymar knew: the past always finds its way back.

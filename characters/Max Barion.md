## Backstory

Max Barion was born into the Hollow Grove Tribe, a once peaceful people known for their connection to nature and the towering spirit statues that stood watch over their land. Life was simple and good, until it wasn’t.

One night, everything changed. Max’s father killed the tribe’s leader, his own father. Some say it was to stop a creeping corruption that no one else saw. Others call it betrayal. Max never really knew the full truth. What he does know is that his father loved his grandfather, and whatever happened, it broke something deep in the tribe. No one cared about Max’s side of the story. Even those who believed his father stayed silent.

After the coup, there was blood. His parents were killed. And the tribe? Scattered.

Only Max and his younger brother made it out. They wandered for a while, barely scraping by sometimes a kind stranger would help, sometimes not. Eventually, a soldier took them in. Taught them how to fight. How to survive.

Years passed. Then came the war. Dragonborn forces pushed into trivarian territory, and like a lot of orphans-turned-warriors, Max and his brother joined the fight. One day, in the middle of a battle Max barely remembers, his brother died right in front of him.

Since then, Max hasn’t really settled. He drinks too much. Talks too little. But somewhere under all of that is someone who still gives a damn. Maybe.

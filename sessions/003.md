Time: Sunset
Place: "Adventurers' guild"

- They just left the adventurer's guild
- Thorne started discussing how the kingdom is being very suspicious how they "don't want to take clues" just because the king was not free when they came
- Max retaliates after he holds his chest and starts arguing
	- Max does an insight check, passes and knows that Thorne really is thinking that and thinks that the authority is wrong
	- Max bargains with Thorne telling him to not do this until they are finished as it could get them killed
- as they were put at a crossroad as to what to do they decided to go to the basement and investigate
- as they went there they discussed how the king could've hired former soldiers as detectives, they all decided it was a stupid move by the king or whoever hired them
- when they reached the house they went atop the basement trapdoor Thorne listened closely and heard there was the sound of one dragonborn that was barely noticeable
- Wymar decided to go down the stairwell first as he is the rogue
	- he took off his shoes and went down quietly
	- as he went down the spiral staircase the light emitting from the room started becoming brighter
	- he peeked from behind the doorway he saw a dragonborn kneeling to a shrine saying something about "avenging you" and "not betraying your trust" to shrine as if it was a person
	- after this he went back up wore his shoes and told the group about the dragonborn
- the group knowing that there is only one dragonborn downstairs decided to go down the stairwell with Wymar at the front and Max at the back
- as they entered the chamber they saw the dragonborn trying to flee through the escape hatch
- Throne dashes to him as Wymar casts mage hand to hold him back and Max transforms into a bat to go and bite the dragonborn
- Thorne pull him back then the dragonborn tries to swing at him and misses he then get grappled by the whole squad
- they then started to interrogate him and get information on the dragonborn
- as the interrogation goes on Aster finds some maps of west faerun and when he looks a bit deeper he finds that there are no markings on the map which is suspicious for maps in a hidden base
- the dragonborn switches from a joking light tone to a serious one and tells Max that he is sorry for whatever happened to him from the dragonborn
- then Max takes his grip off of him and throws his necklace to the side and goes to slouch in a corner of the room
- after this Thorne decides to tie up the dragonborn and leave him to rot until they come back next morning
- the group leaves the house and decides to head to Thorne's home to sleep for the night
- en route a royal official calls to Thorne and tells him he has the belongings of the rest of the group in the carts behind him
	- he then takes Thorne to speak in a little more privacy to the side and asks him if he has any updates after the last one
	- Thorne replies (ask adel he rolled deception and passes)
- after leaving Thorne notices the two king's scouts walk to the official to speak as they walk
- they then head to Thorne's home to sleep for the night
- after they woke up they went straight to the held dragonborn
- when they entered the chamber they found cut ropes with little blood trails leading to the escape hatch going outside of the city
- they discussed what they should do now
	- Thorne and Max decided to go into the hatch
		- at the end found nothing since the tunnel was sealed with stone and dirt seemingly intentional
	- Wymar and Aster decided to go to the messenger's guild
		- they went into the messenger's guild and talked to the receptionist asking where the black ink room is and he points to it 
- Aster starts revealing any invisible ink on the maps using the monocle of invisible ink that the office had available
	- he realizes that the maps need to be stacked on each other in certain arrangement so it makes a map of all hidden routes the dragonborn use
	- he finds under waterdeep a note saying "No more messages. Window closed." and under that message in a different pen, newer it says "Hand still loyal. Await signal."
- after this the party met up in the guild's tavern to discuss what happened
- **Max** and **Thorne**, tension still in their shoulders, glance at the “Hand still loyal” note with growing distrust.
- **Wymar**, likely scanning the exits out of habit, realizes how many conversations in this bar could be heard from the wrong corner.
- **Aster**, with his connection to messaging networks, might be deep in thought—who wrote that phrase? Could someone he once worked with be involved?
- After some time passes
	- Behind the bar, a hooded figure finishes cleaning a glass that didn’t need cleaning. He turns and walks out the back door pausing only briefly when the word “Waterdeep” is spoken at the table.
	- The bartender in low soft voice says “You might want to take those upstairs. The Guild master’s awake.”

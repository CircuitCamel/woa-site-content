- they started off interrogating the noble
- the noble was arrogant but nervous making  shallow threats
- he told them when and where he will give the scroll to the "Black Cloak"
	- at a warehouse near the outer docks in two nights
- a masked person enters the room on accident
- Thorne asks the masked person "would you like to join him?"
- he replies with an awkward laugh and says "no i'd rather not"
- he then requests to get the noble in exchange for money
- when the party denies his request he casts silence on the room and pull out his dagger, not realizing he is surrounded from all sides
- after some hits an older dragonborn fighter enters the room to clear things out
- the masked caster steps out of the room and hides behind a wall
- the dargonborn tries to negotiate with the party for the scroll
- Aster replied by holding the scroll above a lit torch "take another step and it's gone"
- Thorne and the dragonborn exchanged some hits then the dragonborn fled
- as they went outside of the room they saw the caster was already gone
- Thorne was chasing the dragonborn into the city streets as Aster tried to follow closely behind
- then the dragonborn went into an ally when Thorne got there and looked he saw that he was already gone
- then Thorne saw an old man between the crowd and thought he was the dragonborn disguised
- he called for him and shouted "DRAGONBORN DRAGONBORN"
- Aster felt nothing from the old man and tried to stop Throne but nonetheless
- guards came up worried hearing shouting and saw Thorne holding the old man by the collar
- they calmed him down and heard him out then said "That's John sir"
- he said "Yes he's the dragonborn"
- they told him to take it up with the king and escorted him there
- at the reception the receptionist recognized the old man as his grandfather
- hearing what Thorne had to say, he was disappointed and requested that they leave him be and they can go on to the throne room
- when they entered as Thorne explained what had happened Wymar enters the room haphazardly carrying the noble and then dropped him to the ground
- the king looks disappointed by both Thorne and the noble then Aster tries to explain that Thorne acted alone in this matter
- the king replies by saying "It's okay leave it be"
- Thorne asks the king to keep an eye on the old man for a week until it's certain he is not the dragonborn
- they then show the king scroll the king reads it and he was surprised by some of the names on the scroll
- he then tells them "I know this is a copy, show me the real one."
- Thorne tells Aster to only *show* him the scroll but he gives him the scroll nonetheless
- after reading it and hearing about the "Black Cloak" he requests them to give Edrin Vosk the real copy maybe he can sense something they missed
- he then tells them as reward for the mission he gives them a pass to buy one thing and only one thing from any shop in the city on him
- before leaving he tells them that what they found was a spark for the next war

- after what happened this morning the crew was resting at the bar
- they spotted the hooded figure cleaning a clean glass
- then the bartender told them to it's better to discuss this topic with the guild master
- before going up they notice Max staring into his necklace on another table, not talking, not listening so they let him be
- the rest go up to the guild master and greet him
- he sees aster and recognizes the "double steel armed writer"
- they ask him for info about the dragonborn and anything that would help them
- while Aster gets his monocle of invisible ink out he drops his necklace
- he picks it up quickly and silently
- the hooded figure notices then looks at Aster weirdly
- after some talk the guild master shows the party a letter from the king
	- a dismissive letter where the king essentially says "your intel isn't important, weâ€™ll handle this ourselves."
- then they spotted the royal scouts outside
- they talk and the king is requesting to speak with them
- they leave the guildhall leaving Max behind
- they get to the king
- the general and royal informant are there
- the king treats the party as capable operatives, not pawns
- they were not cleared on the info they got from outside sources as to check their loyalty
- the king tells them about a mission
	- to investigate the dragonborn operation base north of sow's foot
	- it must be done quietly
	- the players are to observe, report and capture
- if the dragonborn aren't there, no harm
- if they are there, it's the spark of a second war
- he asked the players because he cannot act officially without tipping his hand
- he promises the players a full pardon sealed and signed
- a royal insignia granting them emergency field authority
- and lastly access to sealed intelligence
- then the general scoffs at them
	- the king interrupts saying "they're not knights. they're not bound. and that's exactly why they'll succeed"
- the party agrees and goes at night
- they get ambushed by two scouts right before reaching the farmhouse
- the party wins over them
- they then find noble crests on the scouts and another insignia of the same family on the ground, Thorne picks it up
- they go into the farmhouse and see two remaining dragonborn and one noble
- the noble tries to run, but get's caught by Throne who slammed him into the ground knocking him out
- the two dragonborn were dealt with by the rest of the party swiftly
- Thorne asks the noble "how do i join?"
- the noble replies scoffing at him and says "why do you want to join? we don't want you."
- Thorne doesn't reply any more
- they find a scroll containing the names of the nobles who are siding with the dragonborn
- before dying one of the dragonborn uses an Ashfang token to send an sos message before he dies
- they flee quickly taking the noble to the messenger's guild guildmaster
- they then put him in an unused room in the guild hall for further interrogation

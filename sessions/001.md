### **The King’s Summons**

Ten years have passed since the last skirmishes of the Dragonborn suppression wars—conflicts that paled in comparison to the brutal settler wars of old. The world has moved on, but for a few, the scars remain fresh.

Across the kingdom of **Trivaria**, three former soldiers—now fugitives—receive unexpected knocks on their doors. **Wymar Kraft**, an Elven rogue with a restless spirit and a thirst for adventure; **Max Barian**, a volatile Human blending druidic instincts and barbarian fury; and **Aster**, a stoic Human fighter turned cleric. Each is escorted under guard, quietly and without resistance, to the capital: **Baldur’s Gate**.

Meanwhile, another summons is delivered—but with far more ceremony. **Thorn Ironsmite**, a decorated Human monk and paladin, receives an official convoy. Though long retired, Thorn was never forgotten by the crown.

The four are brought to the royal palace and seated in a silent marble waiting chamber, the sounds of distant conversation and clinking armor leaking in from the corridors. As they wait to be called before the king, they share brief nods, hesitant glances, and old names.

It has been a decade since they last stood together—if some of them ever truly knew one another at all. Wymar once mentored Aster for a short time; Max and Wymar fought side-by-side in the same platoon. But the years have changed them, hardened them. And none of them know why they’ve been summoned—only that the past is no longer staying buried.

### **The King's Offer**

After a long silence in the marble waiting room, the grand oak doors creaked open. A composed female receptionist in fine, muted livery stepped in, her voice precise and practiced:

> “The King will see you now.”

With steady strides, the party followed her down the wide corridor. Two royal guards flanked the rear—silent, their armor clinking softly with each step, a subtle reminder: they were not guests, not yet. They were being watched.

The chamber they entered was massive—vaulted stone archways, banners of Trivaria swaying gently in the draft, the golden light of high windows pouring down on the throne. And on it sat the King.

He slouched slightly, cheek resting on his fist, eyes watching them without welcome. His face was unreadable.

Around him stood three figures:

- **A hardened army general**, adorned in iron-trimmed crimson.
    
- **The King’s Hand**, cloaked in black and gold, hands folded patiently.
    
- **An ambassador of Waterdeep**, foreign and calm, observing.
    

The party reacted in their own ways:

- **Aster** saluted with mechanical precision, a soldier still wired to serve.
    
- **Max Barian**, reeking of old ale, offered a lazy bow and half-hearted nod.
    
- **Wymar Kraft** hesitated, then bowed after a sharp realization.
    
- **Thorn Ironsmite** stood tall, unmoving—he bowed to no crown.
    

The silence in the room thickened like smoke.

Then, the King spoke—his voice sharp and cold:

> “Fugitives. Veterans. Traitors. Whatever name suits you best... we have a problem.”

He explained the grim pattern: a series of targeted killings. Not of officials—but of their families. Quiet strikes that sowed terror in political hearts. Each scene marked by the same sign: **Dragonborn footprints**, and no survivors.

Then came the deal.

> “Whatever you’ve done—whatever blood stains your past—succeed in solving this, and your crimes are forgotten. Fail, and you die. Either by their hand… or ours.”

The throne room grew silent again.

And so began their mission—not of redemption, but of necessity.

As the weight of the king’s words settled over the chamber, the general stepped forward, voice tight with frustration.

**General:**  
“Your Majesty, with all due respect—trusting _them_ is dangerous. They’re unstable. Traitors.”

The king didn’t move. He let the silence stretch long enough to draw discomfort, then finally, without looking at the general, he spoke.

**King:**  
“They are the only ones both _capable_... and _dispensable_.”

That shut the room down.

He turned his gaze to the group, now fully acknowledging them.  
**King:**  
“You will be placed under the command of Thorn Ironsmite for the duration of this task.”

**Max:**  
“And what if we don’t—”

**Aster:**  
“We deserve answers before—”

But before they could continue, Ironsmite raised a hand sharply, silencing them with a single motion and a firm look. Then, his voice cut through the tension.

**Ironsmite:**  
“Where do we start?”

### **The Noble Suburb**

Escorted by a lone royal agent, the party was led through the quiet, affluent outskirts of Baldur’s Gate—an upper district that looked like an ordinary suburb but housed some of the kingdom’s nobility. Their destination: a nondescript noble residence, recently the site of a brutal slaughter.

The house bore clear signs of forced entry: the front door cracked open, windows smashed in. Inside, the scene was grisly. Blood splattered the walls and floor, with furniture overturned and a deep sword gash embedded in the wooden dining table. It was clear the family hadn’t stood a chance.

As they investigated the room, Wymar Kraft caught a glimpse of movement—a young man peering nervously through the broken window. The boy flinched as their eyes met and tried to flee, only to slip in the mud outside. Wymar swiftly caught him by the collar and dragged him inside.

The interrogation began immediately. The party, veterans hardened by war and betrayal, didn’t mince words.

**Ironsmite:**  
“What is your name?”

**Max:**  
“What the hell are you doing here?”

**Wymar:**  
“Start talking. What did you see?”

Frightened but not defiant, the boy gave a name: _Thomas_. He explained that he had been nearby before dawn and saw at least four Dragonborn figures break into the house. Too scared to interfere, he had hidden and watched as they left toward the nearby woods.

Despite their pressing tone, the boy cooperated. Still, his story raised more questions than answers.

### **The Outer Thicket**

After some quiet discussion, the party let Thomas go. As he walked away, they realized they needed his help to find exactly where the Dragonborn had disappeared to. Without hesitation, Max Barion sprinted after him and gently lifted Thomas onto his shoulder.

**Max:**  
“Come on, you’re coming with us.”

Thomas hesitated but climbed up, pointing north toward the dense Outer Thicket.

Max led the group into the woods with Thomas on his shoulder. Wymar Kraft, the rogue, moved nimbly between the trees, scouting ahead. Max stayed at the front, with the others following close behind. As they neared the mouth of a dark cave, Thomas whispered nervously:

**Thomas:**  
“This is where they went in—the Dragonborn.”

Max pulled out a small flask of spiced tea and offered it to Thomas as a thank-you for guiding them, without revealing its true purpose. Thomas accepted and drank it without hesitation or any sign of discomfort.

**Ironsmite:**  
“You go first.”

Thomas swallowed hard but nodded and stepped into the darkness of the cave. Moments later, four arrows suddenly whistled out, striking the party—Max, Aster, Wymar, and even Ironsmite. Though Ironsmite’s armor protected him better, he still felt the impact.

**Max:**  
“Looks like we walked right into a trap.”

The party turned their eyes upward, spotting four Dragonborn archers smirking down at them, bows drawn and ready.

**Dragonborn:**  
“Thought you could sneak up on us, fugitives? Think again.”

### **The Encounter**

As the Dragonborn archers smirked down from the trees, they slipped down with practiced ease—battle-ready and clearly expecting a fight.

**Aster** was the first to react. With trained precision, he pulled out his revolver and fired at the nearest Dragonborn. The shot rang through the woods—but missed, shattering bark just inches from the target.

**Max**, already bristling with rage, shapeshifted mid-motion into a hulking wolf and lunged forward with gnashing teeth. His jaws snapped on empty air as the Dragonborn dodged.

Then came the enemy’s turn.

The one Aster had aimed for nocked an arrow and fired back in retaliation—missing just as narrowly. Another Dragonborn charged Max with a hefty axe, landing a glancing blow against the thick fur and hide of the wolf-form druid. The third Dragonborn, seeing Ironsmite standing untouched, grinned and hurled his spear.

**Dragonborn:**  
“So you weren’t hit, eh?”

But Thorn Ironsmite’s eyes sharpened. In one swift, fluid movement, he raised his hand and caught the spear mid-flight. With effortless strength, he spun it and launched it back.

The Dragonborn barely had time to react before the weapon slammed into his gut—piercing straight through and knocking him back, gasping in pain.

Seeing their comrade skewered, the other three Dragonborn panicked and turned to flee. Max and Wymar both lashed out in the chaos, but their swings missed as the Dragonborn vanished into the thick brush.

Aster, quick on the draw, aimed his revolver at a nearby tree to drop it in their path—hoping to block their escape. But the shot veered off, striking a completely different tree and splintering bark uselessly. The Dragonborn disappeared into the woods, untouched.

Only the wounded one remained, now doubled over and bleeding heavily. Ironsmite calmly walked up, fist clenched. With a single non-lethal strike to the chest, he knocked the warrior unconscious—spear still embedded, battle over.

As the last of the Dragonborn fled into the thicket, the woods fell silent again, save for the rustling leaves and the party’s heavy breathing.

Then a voice called out—nervous, but oddly impressed.

**Thomas (peeking from behind a rock):**  
“You guys are strong!”

The party snapped toward him.

**Max**, still in beast-like adrenaline, stormed forward. He grabbed Thomas by the collar, lifting him effortlessly before slamming him to the ground. Dirt scattered as the boy let out a panicked yelp.

**Max:**  
“Where were you when all this was happening?!”

**Ironsmite**, stepping in with cold intensity, loomed over him.  
**Ironsmite:**  
“Answer him. Now.”

**Thomas:**  
“I—I was in the cave! I—I didn’t know what to do, I just hid. But I—I found something!”

**Max:**  
“What did you find?”

**Thomas:**  
“A contract… f-for your heads. All four of you. It’s real. I swear.”

**Aster:**  
“Where is it?”

**Thomas:**  
“B-Back pocket. Right side.”

Without a word, Ironsmite reached down, pulled the parchment from the boy’s pocket, and unfolded it—his face unreadable as his eyes scanned the contents.

The forest wind rustled through the trees again, but this time… the silence was heavier.

### War flashback
- the players start in a battlefield on Gwynneth they find five dragonborn who had no trivarian's opposing them
- they all coincidentally met in that small skirmish
- when Max Barion's brother had just been killed he turned into a Worg and starts fighting them
- after a couple rounds, they notice that Garrick Stonefell has started to cough and look weak
- Thorne Ironsmite asks if Garrick is doing okay, he replies saying it's nothing
- when Wymar Kraft casts detect magic he cannot focus on one magic source as someone has an immense magical aura covering his entire sphere of detect magic
- then a dragonborn noticed how Garrick has become weak, he sprints his way while doing so Thorne hits him with an opportunity attack but the dragonborn seemingly doesn't care and just keeps going then beheads Garrick as Thorne screams "Garrick NO!"
- then they all snap and finish off the remaining dragonborn and in the end help the army finish the last battle

### Start of session
- All the players except Thorne were gracefully dragged to the king’s quarters.
    
    - Aster didn’t have time to pack his musket, only managing to grab his revolver.
        
    - Max Barion was hauled in, still drunk.
        
    - Wymar Kraft offered no resistance and followed silently.
        
    
- They were brought to a marble waiting room with chairs lining the wall, where a bored Thorne Ironsmite was already waiting.
    
    - Aster saluted Thorne sharply and greeted Wymar, his former mentor.
        
    - Max gave Thorne a hazy grin and reminded him of the battle they fought together—and the person they both lost.
        
    
- A receptionist knocked, entered, and lingered uncomfortably on the supposed fugitives before announcing that the king was ready to see them.
    
- They entered the king’s chamber. Beside the throne stood a hardened general, the king’s hand, and an envoy from Waterdeep.
    
    - Aster saluted with mechanical precision.
        
    - Max gave a clumsy, drunken bow.
        
    - Wymar bowed late, as if suddenly remembering protocol.
        
    - Thorne stood firm, bowing to no crown.
        
    
- Silence filled the hall until the king finally spoke:
    
    > “Fugitives. Veterans. Traitors. Whatever name suits you best—we have a problem.”
    
- He described the grim pattern: a string of targeted killings—not of officials, but of their families. Quiet, precise strikes that sent terror through political circles. Each scene bore the same mark: **Dragonborn footprints**—and no survivors.
    
- The king offered a deal: solve the mystery, and their crimes would be erased. Fail, and they’d die—by the enemy’s hands… or the crown’s.
    
- The general objected, calling them unstable traitors.
    
- Without looking at him, the king replied:
    
    > “They are the only ones both capable _and_ expendable enough for this mission.”
    
- He placed them under the command of Thorne Ironsmite.
    
- As Max and Aster began to protest, Ironsmite cut them off with a firm:
    
    > “Where do we start?”

- Escorted by a royal agent, they were taken to the scene of the latest murder in **Manorborn**. The agent departed shortly after.
    
- The manor bore clear signs of forced entry: the front door splintered, windows shattered. Inside, the scene was grisly—blood stained the walls and floor, furniture was overturned, and a deep sword gash marred the dining table. It was clear the family hadn’t stood a chance.
    
- As the party investigated, Wymar Kraft noticed a figure watching through the broken window—a young man, startled, who turned to flee but slipped in the mud. Wymar caught him by the collar and dragged him inside.
    
- The interrogation began at once. These were veterans—no patience for games.
    
    - “What’s your name?”
        
    - “What the hell are you doing here?”
        
    - “Start talking. What did you see?”
        
    
- Frightened but compliant, the boy gave his name: _Thomas_.
    
    - He claimed to have seen four Dragonborn figures break into the house before dawn. Too scared to intervene, he had hidden and watched them flee toward the nearby woods.
        
    
- Though his story was suspiciously convenient, the party let him go—until they realized they needed him to pinpoint where the Dragonborn had gone.
    
- Max Barion sprinted after him, scooped him up gently, and said:
    
    > “Come on. You’re coming with us.”
    
- Thomas hesitated, then pointed north—toward the **Outer Thicket**.

- Max led the way with Thomas on his shoulder. Wymar scouted ahead through the trees. The rest followed, until they reached the mouth of a dark cave.
    
- Thomas whispered:
    
    > “This is where they went in—the Dragonborn.”
    
- Max offered him a sip from a small flask of spiced tea as thanks, careful not to reveal its true purpose. Thomas drank without hesitation or effect.
    
- Ironsmite ordered him inside first.
    
- Thomas hesitated, then entered. Moments later—
    
    —_Thwip-thwip-thwip-thwip_
    
    Four arrows flew out from the darkness, striking Max, Aster, Wymar, and Ironsmite. Though Ironsmite’s armor absorbed much of the blow, the ambush was clear.
    
- The party looked up to see **four Dragonborn archers** perched above, smirking, bows drawn.
    
- Combat erupted. Ironsmite hurled a spear back, impaling one of the Dragonborn and wounding him severely. The remaining three fled into the woods, vanishing before the party could bring them down.
    
- As the party regrouped, Thomas peeked out from behind a rock near the cave entrance.
    
    > “You guys are strong!” he called out.
    
- Max, still in beast form, lunged at him. He transformed mid-air and slammed Thomas to the ground, driving his knee into the boy’s back.
    
- The second interrogation began.
    
- Thomas gasped, saying he had found a contract inside the cave—one that named the four of them as targets.
    
- “It’s in my back pocket,” he added.
    
- Thorne Ironsmite reached down, pulled the paper free, and began to read.

Time: Early Afternoon
Place: Outer Thicket

- The session begins where they last left off.
    
    [Max Barion](/characters/Max-Barion) has Thomas pinned under his knee while the party begins questioning the remaining Dragonborn.
    
- The Dragonborn attempts to bite down on a vial of poison to end his life.
    
    [Thorne Ironsmite](/characters/Thorne-Ironsmite) reacts swiftly, slapping him non-lethally and leaving him on 1 HP.
    
    They tie a rope through his mouth to prevent another suicide attempt.
    
- Two of the royal scouts arrive and take custody of both Thomas and the captured Dragonborn.
    
    As one scout handles the Dragonborn, Ironsmite notices a folded note in the prisoner’s pocket. He reads it:
    
    _“Don’t let them know about the Old Quarter.”_
    
    Ironsmite pockets the note silently, keeping the information from the party.
    
- Ironsmite investigates the cave further and finds a sword bearing the Ember Fang emblem on its pommel.
    
    He unscrews the pommel, hides it, and again says nothing to the others.
    
- While en route to the King’s Quarters, the party encounters a nobleman who was a neighbor of the murdered family.
    
    Max Barion questions him, asking about a young man named Thomas, suspecting him to be a noble.
    
    The nobleman denies knowing Thomas, but mentions an old man — white-haired and deeply wrinkled — who had recently inquired about the murdered family’s residence.
    
    The nobleman’s wife calls him away shortly after.
    
- Max confides in Ironsmite, expressing suspicion toward the scouts and Thomas.
    
    Ironsmite tells [Wymar Kraft](/characters/Wymar-Kraft) to trail ahead and keep an eye on them.
    
- At the King’s Quarters, the receptionist informs them that the King is currently unavailable.
    
    The party submits a report stating:
    
    - They captured one Dragonborn and three escaped.
        
    - They discovered a contract signed with a single letter: “V.”
        
        It lists all four of their names, even though they barely know each other.
        
    
- When they request more information, the receptionist directs them to the Adventurers’ Guild.
    
- Before heading there, the group decides to detour into the Old Quarter.
    
    They find an abandoned house with the old Saber-tooth and Flame emblem.
    
    From a nearby alleyway, they hear the clatter of wooden swords — children are playing.
    
    Max, transformed into a rat, scouts the alley and confirms it’s just local kids.
    
    He then checks the house and finds a poor family living there.
    
    The neighboring home is abandoned and contains a trapdoor leading to a dark basement.
    
- The party chooses to seek help from the Adventurers’ Guild.

### **At the Adventurers’ Guild**

- Inside, many recognize Wymar Kraft. A half-elf even salutes him.
    
    The group heads to the guildmaster’s office — Wymar enters with [Aster](/characters/Aster), his student.
    
- The guildmaster is an old woman with an eye patch. Without looking up, she says:
    
    _“When they said Wymar Kraft walked in with a drunk, a soldier, and an Ironhammer… I figured I was being toyed with.”_
    
    She leans back. _“So? What’s this about Ember Fang?”_
    
- Wymar smirks. _“Still good, you old hag.”_
    
- She demands to know:
    
    - What the King’s role in all this is.
        
    - Why the scouts aren’t taking action.
        
    - What the party expects from the Guild.
        
    
- Wymar answers honestly:
    
    - The King personally ordered the mission.
        
    - They have no idea why the scouts are inactive.
        
    - They want three answers — one for each of their questions.
        
    
- The guildmaster agrees.

### **Wymar’s Three Questions**

1. **“Why is that emblem still used, and who might be using it?”**
    
    _“That emblem isn’t just a symbol — it’s a wound. Ember Fang was one of the first resistance cells after the war. Most think they were wiped out in the Purge of ’79. But someone’s been stenciling the old flame again. Could be loyalists. Could be someone trying to resurrect their image. Rebels love legends.”_
    
2. **“What happened to the Dragonborn in the 10 years after the war? Why would they be in the Old Quarters?”**
    
    _“After the treaty? Most were moved to the outskirts or island prisons. Some got amnesty — but only if they renounced the old ways. The rest vanished. Sometimes a Dragonborn shows up in the pits, the docks, or begging on corners. But the loyal ones? They’re in hiding.”_
    
3. **“Why did the Old Quarters end up like that?”**
    
    _“So you want a history lesson, eh? That was once a thriving Dragonborn district. When Trivaria came, they took it — by force, obviously. And who wants to build a kingdom on bones?”_
    

  

- She ends the exchange with: _“That’s your three.”_
    
- Wymar places three gold coins on her desk. _“You never saw me.”_
    
    She takes the coins and nods.
    

  

The party exits the guild master's office.
